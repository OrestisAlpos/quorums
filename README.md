This repo contains research tools related to _Byzantine quorum systems_ [4,5],
such as parsing the quorum and fail-prone systems [4,5], checking the
_Q3_ [5] and _B3_ conditions [4], checking for the existence of guilds [2, 4],
parsing the quorum slices from the live blockchain of Stellar [5]
using the stellarbeat API [6].

The tools have been used during the development of various scientific papers, e.g., [1,2,3].
The code has been developed by members and students of the Crypto [7] group at University of Bern.
